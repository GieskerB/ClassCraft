# List of all Level Rewards

There are 20 levels in total per class!

## Brainstorming

General idea for level rewards (not particular order):

- On class selection: gain tool / weapon
- iconic armor
- set compas location
- cosmetics:
    - unique banner
    - particles
    - horse customization
    - title
- access to upgrade tool
    - later requires "special" material -> access to "specializer"
- access to own horse
- access to own pet
- access to own bagpack
- Material upgrade (bow -> add in lore and add flat dmg):
    - to iron
    - to diamond
    - to netherite
- passive bonus:
    - pos+
    - neg-
    - pos++
- special power:
    - double drop chance
    - telekinesis
    - extra exp drops

Gain skill points (SP) alongside level ups for the upgrade tool.

### Class selection

1. Warrior (Sword)
2. Hunter (Bow)
3. Miner (Pickaxe)
4. Lumberjack (Axe)
5. Farmer (Hoe)

### Skill points

Idea: spend skill points to upgrade tools
This is needed to determine to number of SP gained in total

#### Enchantments of main tool

1. Sword (7|25)
    - Fire Aspect II
    - Looting III
    - Sharpness V
    - Smite V
    - Bane of Arthropods V
    - Knockback II
    - Sweeping Edge III
2. Bow (4|9)
    - Power V
    - Punch II
    - Flame I
    - Infinity I
3. Pickaxe (3|9)
    - Efficiency V
    - Fortune III
    - Silk Touch I
4. Axe (6|24)
    - Fortune III
    - Silk Touch I
    - Efficiency V
    - Sharpness V
    - Smite V
    - Bane of Arthropods V
5. Hoe (3<9)
    - Efficiency V
    - Fortune III
    - Silk Touch I

#### Scrape idea

Level difference to high -> Hard to balance
Not all level make sense / are wanted
Upgrade tools with loot / material

#### Purely cosmetic idea

use SP (or other name) to unlock cosmetics.
